% Matlab fumdamentals
% Transpose a Vector
b = [2;3;5;7]        
c = b'               

% Concatenating Arrays
% Horizontal Concatenation
A = rand(3,4)
B = rand(3,2)
C = [A, B]
% Vertical Concatenation
A = rand(3,4)
B = rand(2,4)
C = [A; B]

% Reshaping Arrays
x = rand(260,1)
y = reshape(x,5,52)
y = reshape(x,5,[]) % leave one of the dimensions blank when calling reshape and that dimension will be calculated automatically. 

% Accessing Multiple Elements of Arrays
% remove elements from vector 
                            output:
v = [1 2 3 4 5]             [1 2 3 4 5] 
v([2 4]) = []               [1 3 5]
   
% round numbers in an array M to n decimal places
round(M,n)

% identify and count missing values in a vector
isnan(v)
% count the number of missing values 
nnz(isnan(v)) % nnz: number non-zero

% Statistical Operations on Matrices
% Many statistical functions accept an optional dimensional argument 
A = rand(12, 20)
% mean() calculates the average of each column by default
mean(A, "omitnan") % omitting missing values
mean(A, 2, "omitnan") % by row
% min() and max() min and max functions also calculate the minimum and maximum of the columns of a matrix by default
% They omit missing values by default
min(A,[],2) % by rows
%  get the mean, minimum, and maximum, of all of the elements in array
max(A, [], "all")
min(A, [], "all")
mean(A, "all")

% calculate the difference between elements of a  vector
diff()
%  calculates the sum of an element with all the previous elements of a vector
% if the input is a matrix, the sums are calculated by column
cumsum( ) 

% Backslash Operator for the caculation of Matrix 
x=B/A	% Solves x*A = B (for x)
x=A\B	% Solves A*x = B (for x)
